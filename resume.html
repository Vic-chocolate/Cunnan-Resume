            <p>
                Upon completing high school studies in 2018, I joined a youth organization called the Global Network for 
                Youth Enhancement, which is dedicated to promoting educational, charitable, and extracurricular initiatives 
                that improve the lives of young scholars—both boys and girls—throughout Liberia. I initially became a member 
                in a general capacity, but due to my strong communication and analytical skills, as well as my effective 
                problem-solving abilities, I was later appointed as the Chairman and Spokesman of the organization. 
                These skills played a key role in helping the organization secure financial support and advance its 
                developmental goals.
